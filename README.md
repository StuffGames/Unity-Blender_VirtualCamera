# Unity-Blender_VirtualCamera
 This is meant to be a work around to a virtual camera in Blender using my knowledge in Blender and developing on iOS through Unity.

There is a bit of setup to do to get the project working properly but it is not too much.

For more info and proper details head over to the Wiki page.

# REQUIREMENTS:
- Unity Editor
- Blender
- Unity Remote 5 App
- iOS Device

--> The rest of the project is contained in this GitHub repository which has the Unity Scripts, Project details, and python code for the Blender Add-On.
